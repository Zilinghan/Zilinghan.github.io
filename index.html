            For memorable stream queries, the limit case of semi-memoryless stream
            queries, is more of theoretical interests. To deal with such case in
            theory, much more agents are required in the parallel compuation, so we
            extend the expressiveness of BSP model and develop a new behavioral
            theory of BSP algorithm with infinite number of available agents.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong> MapReduce is an algorithm for processing large data sets in parallel
            and bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model is a
            model for parallel computation consisting of alternating
            computation and communication phases.
            In this article, we extend the normal execution of MapReduce from processing large finite data sets to
            processing stream queries with input data stream assumed to continue indefinitely.
            We first propose a classification of stream queries to divide stream queries into three classes:
            memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the implementation models
            for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, since handling some stream queries requires a
            large amount of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to Infinite-Agent BSP (Inf-Ag-BSP)
            computation model, which can capture unbounded number of agents though only finitely many of them will be
            simultaneously activated. A behavioral theory is developed for Inf-Ag-BSP model based on the behavioral
            theory of general BSP model, which consists of the axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP
            abstract state machine (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASM captures Inf-Ag-BSP computations.

            It is the final project of UIUC course ECE385: Digital System
            Laboratory. The game is designed and implemented using System Verilog on
            FPGA.
        </li>
        <li>
            The game has two mouse (one USB mouse and one PS2 mouse) as inputs and
            VGA display as outputs. The game supports both single-player mode and
            double-player mode. The video display of the motion of the fruits to be
            cut on the monitor and the mouse serves as "knife" to cut the fruit when
            colliding with the fruits
