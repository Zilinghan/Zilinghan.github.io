    "tldr": "The concept of a learning healthcare system (LHS) envisions a self-improving network where multimodal data from patient care are continuously analyzed to enhance future healthcare outcomes. However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges in data sharing and privacy protection. Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a transformative and promising approach that has the potential to address these challenges by enabling collaborative learning from decentralized data while safeguarding patient privacy. This paper proposes a vision for integrating PPFL into the healthcare ecosystem to achieve a truly LHS as defined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Roundtable.",
